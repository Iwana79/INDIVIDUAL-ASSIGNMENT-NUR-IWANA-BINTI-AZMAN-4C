  <p align="justify"style="max-width:800px">When I think of family, I think of the people who will always be there for me, the ones I cherish most. People like and respect me more when I am powerful and effective, and they hate and distrust me less when I am weak and helpless. The folks I call family are the ones that are always there for me, even when things are the worst they can be.</p>

  <p align="justify"style="max-width:800px">I was raised in a conservative Muslim family, which may explain why I am such a reserved person now. However, as a result of it, we developed a powerful method of distinguishing between what was right and what was wrong.I think my family taught me this well.</p>

  <p align="justify"style="max-width:800px">In spite of my numerous failures, my parents had great faith in me as a youngster. My parents' trust in me stemmed from their belief that I was capable of doing everything I set out to do. But at the end of the day, when I returned to them and acknowledged that I had failed, they always offered me refuge and hope and taught me how to move forward.The fact that I was never pressured to accomplish anything was another huge effect. My family always let me make my own decisions, particularly when it came to my job and the things I wanted to accomplish and how I wanted to do them.</p>

  <p align="justify"style="max-width:800px">I'm quite thankful for their unwavering support, which has continued even today. My family has always been at my side, encouraging and supporting me, and they continue to do so even when I am in the most difficult circumstances. In turn, it is also my full-time obligation to care for my family, no matter what occurs, and I make every effort to do so in this situation.</p>
